Physician,Health Care,Physicians provide preventative care but also treat and diagnose a range of illnesses in their patients. Schooling and competition is intense for all types of doctors but the payoff is high.,208000.0,19400.0,7.4,10.0,10.0,8.0,2.0,6.0,Above Average,High,Average,"Physicians made a median salary of $208,000 in 2021. The best-paid 25% made $208,000 that year, while the lowest-paid 25% made $132,060. The path to becoming a physician is a long one. Most future physicians start their journeys by majoring in a subject like biology or pre-med during their undergraduate years. Majoring in one of the sciences helps prepare students for the Medical College Admission Test, or MCAT, which is the entrance exam for medical school. Most medical schools take four years to complete, and that includes a series of rotations through different branches of medicine. Prospective physicians can get either a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) degree or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) degree, both of which allow them to practice medicine. The main difference between the degrees is area of emphasis: D.O.s tend to emphasize holistic health, while M.D.s typically take a more targeted approach to diagnosing and treating issues. For McLean, the rotations helped him decide which area of medicine to work in. “It was probably the first day of my internal medicine rotation, and I said, ‘This is it,’” he says. “I really liked taking the patient history, the aspects of preventive care, and the cognitive thinking, the curiosity needed, and the detective work involved with solving the mysteries of illness.”At the end of medical school, students have to take and pass board exams to be matched with a residency program. During these residency programs, physicians complete supervised work for several years before becoming full-fledged physicians. Some might also subspecialize with a fellowship.But they’re not done yet. Physicians also have to be licensed in the states where they will practice. Because each state administers licensure a little bit differently, the American Medical Association recommends contacting the state licensing board directly and inquiring about the requirements. The AMA also advises building in time for obtaining a license, since it can take longer than expected. Physicians must also get credentialed with insurance companies so they can get paid.

Candidates must take the four-hour-long Dental Admission Test to apply to dental school in the U.S. The American Dental Education Association recommends students take the test at least one year before they intend to start dental school and after completing their biology and chemistry prerequisites. Many students take the admissions test after their third year of college, according to the ADEA. Dental school students also must pass a national board exam. Traditionally, this has been the two-part National Board Dental Examination, but that is being phased out and replaced by the Integrated National Board Dental Examination, which launched in 2020. Landing a residency is extremely competitive. There are 67 residency programs in the U.S., and only 4% of applicants are admitted to a program, Roberts says.

Continuing education courses are generally required to keep licensure as well.  Certification is another hurdle, which is not always essential, but nonetheless can portray expertise in a particular area of psychology, from family psychology to rehabilitation psychology. Psychologists can obtain certification through the American Board of Professional Psychology or the American Board of Professional Neuropsychology. School psychologists and organizational psychologists, however, have differing training requirements.  A major difference between a psychologist and a psychiatrist is that unlike psychiatrists, psychologists do not earn a doctor of medicine from medical school. While both focus on mental health, psychiatrists also prescribe medications and facilitate medication plans. Psychologists generally focus on psychotherapy-based treatment plans and rarely handle medications. ",https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/psychologist,1,0,psychologists,9,107

While it’s not necessary to earn a degree before becoming an automotive technician, earning an associate degree can be helpful, and many employers prefer to hire technicians who have completed a program at a college or vocational school.“I’m a big fan of at least getting a two-year degree,” Spohr says, adding that many academic skills learned in school can help an automotive technician succeed. Reading comprehension is important for understanding repair manuals from auto manufacturers, speech and communication classes can come in handy when interacting with customers, and writing skills are essential for creating repair orders that spell out what’s needed to fix the vehicle.Even some psychology can come into play when dealing with customers, according to Spohr. After experiencing car trouble, a customer’s first point of contact may be the automotive technician who has to deal with a range of possible situations. “Their car just broke down on their way to work, and they had to take their kids to school and they had a doctor’s appointment. Now they have to cancel all that,” he says.One way for students to determine their interest in exploring auto mechanics as a career is attending a high school auto shop class. Post high school, Spohr recommends finding and enrolling in a training program, even if that means moving to a new town to be nearer to the college or vocational school where the program is offered.“Having advanced training is absolutely mandatory,” he says. “Ten, 20, 30 years ago, you could pretty much fumble your way around fixing a car, and (now) it’s just not so.

This can mean four years pursuing a bachelor’s degree, followed by three years of law school – or four years if a student attends law school part-time. Students must pass an exam to be admitted to law school. This might be the LSAT or the GRE, depending on the school. As students narrow down their top choices, they should note which test to study for. It is also worth checking whether their programs of interest are offered by one of the 199 American Bar Association-approved law schools.Following law school graduation, prospective attorneys must pass the multiday bar exam for the state in which they want to practice. Each state has its own bar exam and procedure to become licensed, but some states offer reciprocity, meaning that qualified lawyers in good standing can apply to practice in an eligible state without taking another bar exam.Lawyers also may have to meet continuing education requirements throughout their careers. In Texas, Santamaria says, that means completing 15 hours of continuing education each year, some of which must be ethics training.“I will say, as a practicing attorney, almost every attorney needs it,” he says. “We’re constantly in training.

The best-paid 25% made $208,000 that year, while the lowest-paid 25% made $100,550. A college degree isn’t a blanket requirement to become a pilot. But some airlines require a degree, so it’s recommended to give yourself the best choice of jobs in this field. Pilots receive a lot of on-the-job training, but Dornacker says, “normally, you get training from a scheduled operator trainer. There are Part 141 schools, which is a school that actually has a syllabus to it. They are moderate to expensive cost.” Military, college or civilian flight schools are the typical routes to becoming a pilot, says Shane Bise, first officer at NetJets, a private jet company based in Columbus, Ohio.  “With college and civilian training, one typically starts as a student pilot and works up through their commercial pilot license,” says Bise, who is based in Cleveland.At that point, they have a few options. “Most go on to become flight instructors; however, some go on to tow banners in high tourist areas,” he says. “Sometimes, one can get lucky and find a smaller operator willing to give them a chance as a low-time pilot, but those opportunities are few and far between. After building up to between 1,000 and 1,500 hours (of actual pilot flying time), many more opportunities open up due to eligibility for the ATP license, which is the highest license available to a commercial pilot.” If a high salary is important to you, Dornacker says consider attending an aviation college, which could almost guarantee you a job after you graduate. That said, tuition and other fees could cost you well into the six figures. “It’s not very lucrative starting out because typically your first year, the salary is somewhere between the $30,000 and $50,000 range as a first officer,” he says. “As you get more senior with time, the better flying jobs come, and of course the better pay. The pay can exceed $350,000 a year now as a senior airline pilot at a place like FedEx, UPS or Delta.” If you’re considering a career as a pilot, Dornacker says you must pass a medical exam. “The first thing I would do before I put any serious money down in flight training is see if you can pass an Federal Aviation Administration Class 1 medical exam, because if you can’t, there’s no sense in spending any money on training. If you can hold a Class 2 medical but not a Class 1, at least you can become a corporate pilot. In order to work for a scheduled air carrier, you must have FAA Class 1 medical.” Pilots should also have strong math skills and a good grasp of mechanics, Bise says. “One skill that I think is often overlooked is customer service. … A pilot telling passengers what is causing a delay is such a small thing but goes a long way in conveying confidence and calmness to passengers, especially those who are nervous fliers.”Dornacker adds, “It’s good to be a good three-dimensional thinker because you’re operating in a three-dimensional environment. Let’s face it: We’re taking a very heavy aircraft/vehicle, putting it up at 37,000 feet at three-quarters the speed of sound, flying in pressurized, air-conditioned comfort. You’ve got to be able to tie all this stuff together and be a quick thinker when something does go amiss and have a solution to it.”In those quick-thinking situations, Dornacker says pilots primarily use the aircraft manuals to determine the appropriate fix and are only expected to have a few things memorized. While there’s no continuing education required as a pilot, Dornacker says, “you do have to prove yourself as an airline captain every six or nine months, depending on the air carrier and the FAA.” For that, you can expect to spend a couple days in ground school, which will cover any changes to rules and regulations, company policy updates and instruction in crew resource management. “After you do that, then you go off to the flight simulators.” ",https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/pilot,1,1,pilot,12,211
